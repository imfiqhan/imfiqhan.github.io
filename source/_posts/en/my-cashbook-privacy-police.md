# PRIVACY POLICY

My Cashbook ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting any personal information you provide within our mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle the data stored locally on your device when you use our App. By using our App, you acknowledge and agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Data Storage
1. Local Storage: My Cashbook operates by storing your data locally on your device. This means that all the information entered into the App, including financial transactions, personal notes, or any other data, is saved solely within the local storage of your device.

2. No Data Collection: My Cashbook does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information from your device or any other external sources. The App only accesses and manages the data stored locally on your device.

## 2. Data Security
We take data security seriously and have implemented reasonable measures to protect the information stored locally on your device. However, please be aware that no method of data transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.

## 3. Third-Party Services and Links
My Cashbook may include links to third-party websites, services, or applications. However, once you leave our App or interact with any third-party services, this Privacy Policy no longer applies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services you access through our App to understand how they handle your information.

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, and any changes will be effective upon posting the revised version within the App. We recommend reviewing this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.

## 5. Contact Us
